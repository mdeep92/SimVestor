# Simvestor Game App

This is a basic TypeScript project scaffold for the Simvestor game app. You can start building your game logic in TypeScript from here.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (if not already):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. To compile TypeScript:
   ```sh
   npx tsc
   ```
3. To run your app, add an entry point (e.g., `index.ts`), then compile and run with Node.js:
   ```sh
   node dist/index.js
   ```

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Place your TypeScript source files here
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output

## Customization
Update this README as you add features to your game.
